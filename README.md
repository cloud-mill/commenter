# Commenter üó®Ô∏è

**Commenter** is a web server for everyone who wants to have commenting functionalities on their applications.

### What's the challenge? üí™

- Implementing a commenting system with nested threads and multiple levels of engagement, such as replies and reactions,
  presents challenges primarily around data structure, performance, and scalability;
- The data model must efficiently handle the complexity of relationships and hierarchies within comments. Performance
  optimization is key to ensure quick loading and posting of comments, especially as the volume of data grows;
- Ensuring the commenting system can scale to accommodate an increasing number of users and comments while maintaining
  fast response times is also a significant technical hurdle.

### Features ‚ú®

- **Cloud-Native Architecture**: designed and dockerizable as a microservice for seamless integration into cloud
  ecosystems like Kubernetes (k8s) deployments, stateless making it inherently scalable and resilient.

- **Comprehensive API Suite**: a flexible and rich set of RESTful APIs designed with ergonomics in mind, facilitating a
  wide array of commenting scenarios for various digital content forms like blogs, news articles, and forums. It also
  supports social features, enabling users to express themselves through comments, threaded replies, and reactions with
  emojis.

- **Rusty**: Built in Rust, with performance and reliability. It remains fast and stable under demanding
  workloads.

- **MongoDB Powered**: Leveraging the flexibility and speed of MongoDB for data storage. We're also committed to
  broadening our database support, with plans to integrate with other databases, offering you the freedom to choose the
  best storage solution for your needs.

### Ideas üí°

Comment sections are structured as a tree, with:

- **Resource**: The digital content (posts, blogs, articles, forums) that comments are associated with.
- **Root Comment**: The initial comment level where users can begin threaded discussions.
- **Branch Comments**: Subsequent levels of threaded comments that stem from root comments or other branches.

### Requirements

all that's required is a config.json file placed at /etc/commenter/config.json. This file includes all necessary
configurations for the server and MongoDB connection parameters, Here's an example of what your development config.json
should look like:

```
{
  "server_host": "127.0.0.1",
  "server_port": 7000,
  "mongodb_config": {
    "mongo_username": "commenter",
    "mongo_password": "commenter",
    "mongo_host": "localhost",
    "mongo_port": 27017,
    "mongo_db_name": "commenter",
    "mongo_auth_source": "admin",
    "mongo_max_connections": 100
  }
}
```

- server_host (string): The IP address where the Commenter will run.
- server_port (number): The port number on which the Commenter server will listen.
- mongodb_config: This section includes the MongoDB connection details. Ensure that these match the credentials and
  connection details provided in the MongoDB instance you set up.

### Development MongoDB Setup üõ†Ô∏è

```
cd dev 

docker build -t commenter-mongo:latest -f mongo.Dockerfile .

docker run -v commenter-mongo-data:/data/db -p 27017:27017 -d commenter-mongo:latest
```

to connect with this local MongoDB container, the `mongodb_config` is

```
{
    "mongo_username": "commenter",
    "mongo_password": "commenter",
    "mongo_host": "localhost",
    "mongo_port": 27017,
    "mongo_db_name": "commenter",
    "mongo_auth_source": "admin",
    "mongo_max_connections": 100
  }
```

### Spin up the commenter! üöÄ

```
cargo run --package commenter --bin commenter
```

### If you doubt it, dockerise it! üê≥

```
docker build -t commenter:latest .

docker run -v /etc/commenter/config.json:/etc/commenter/config.json -p 7000:7000 commenter:latest
```

^^ this assumes you have prepared your `config.json` at local `/etc/commenter/config.json` that would be volume mounted
into the container; and you want to run the commenter container at local port `7000`
